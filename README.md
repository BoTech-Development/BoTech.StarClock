# Status
This project is still in development but the following goals are to be achieved by the end of September 2025:

1. An update system that keeps the app running on the Star up to date.
2. The functionality to upload images to the star and display them in a slideshow. The whole thing should be controllable and manageable via an app.
3. Control of the NeoPixel LEDs located in each tip (15 per tip) via the app.
4. Controlling the speakers via a mobile device
